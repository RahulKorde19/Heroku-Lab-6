Using the URLconf defined in mysite.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:
polls/
admin/
The empty path didn’t match any of these.
You’re seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page.

/polls :- Hello, world. You're at the polls index.

Question 1: What is the link to your github repository for this lab?

Question 2: After starting a brand new Django application and running the runserver command, what does the browser show you?

Question 3: After creating the first view within polls, what does the browser show you when navigating to / and to /polls respectively?

Question 4: What is a Django migration and why do we need them?

Question 5: What do you see after you log into the Django adminstration site? From a high levle, how do you get custom models to appear in the Django admin page?

Question 6: What do you see when you go to /polls/38/ in your browser? What about /polls/38/results and /polls/38/vote? What happens when you don’t put a number, and instead use a string? How would you modify the urls.py file to allow arbitrary alphabetic characters?

Question 7: Why is it a bad idea to hardcode urls into the templates?

Question 8: What are the benefits of using Django's generic views over writing views 'the hard way'? When should you use a generic view and when shouldn't you use a generic view?
